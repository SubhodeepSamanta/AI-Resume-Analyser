## Phase 4: Start All Servers ‚è≥ YOU DO THIS

You need **3 terminal windows** running simultaneously:

### Terminal 1: Python AI API

```powershell
cd ai-model
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python api.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
Loading AI Resume Analyzer...
‚úì Model loaded successfully!

============================================================
AI Resume Analyzer API Server
============================================================
Server running on: http://localhost:5001
API Endpoint: POST http://localhost:5001/analyze
============================================================

* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5001
```

- [ ] AI model loaded
- [ ] Server running on port 5001
- [ ] No errors

**Leave this terminal running!**

---

### Terminal 2: Node.js Backend

```powershell
cd backend
npm start
```

**Expected output:**
```
Server is running on http://localhost:5000
```

- [ ] Server running on port 5000
- [ ] No errors

**Leave this terminal running!**

---

### Terminal 3: React Frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
  VITE v6.x.x  ready in XXX ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

   - Or use one from `ai-model/datasets/data/data/ENGINEERING/` folder
   - Must be a PDF file!

2. **Upload it**
   - Click "Browse files" button
   - OR drag-and-drop the PDF onto the upload area

3. **(Optional) Add job description**
   - Paste a job description in the textarea
   - This improves matching accuracy

4. **Click "Analyze Resume"**

**Expected:**
- [ ] "Analyzing..." appears
- [ ] Takes 2-5 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "AI service is not available"

**Problem:** Python AI not running

**Solution:**
1. Open new terminal
2. `cd ai-model`
3. `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
4. `python api.py`
5. Wait for "Server running on: http://localhost:5001"

---

### Issue: "Model not found" error

**Problem:** AI model not trained yet

**Solution:**
1. `cd ai-model`
2. `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
3. `python model.py`
4. Type `1` then Enter
5. Type `yes` then Enter
6. Wait 5-10 minutes for training

---

### Issue: Import errors in Python

**Problem:** Packages not installed

**Solution:**
1. `cd ai-model`
2. `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Wait for installation to complete

---

### Issue: "NLTK data not found"

**Problem:** NLTK datasets not downloaded

**Solution:**
```powershell
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"
```

---

### Issue: Port already in use

**Problem:** Another app using the port

**Solution:**
- Frontend (5173): Close other Vite servers
- Backend (5000): Close other Node servers
- AI API (5001): Close other Python servers

Or change ports in:
- `backend/server.js` (PORT variable)
- `ai-model/api.py` (port=5001)
- `frontend/.env` (VITE_API_URL)

---

### Issue: Can't see cursor blob

**Problem:** Browser doesn't support the effect

**Solution:** Try Chrome/Edge (works best). Or it's fine - just cosmetic!

---
